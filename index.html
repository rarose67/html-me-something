                             <p>I love anime because I love animated shows in general, but more specifically I love the fluid is Artistic drawing style specific to Japanese animation. I also love that anime more often tackles deep and more complex subject matter then most western animated shows.</p>

                             <p>Since I'm not very athletic and it takes a lot of time and planning for me to go out places, I've always been into TV. I really like shows that deal with either science fiction, fantasy, or have some historical relevance.

                                <p>Video games provide away from me to interact with the with the characters in the story in a way unlike other things of media. I really enjoy games which allow me to growth along with the character and allowed me to experience the emotion of the story in a new way by actually being the one performing the actions which the story revolves around.</p>
